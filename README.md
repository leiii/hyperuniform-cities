# Hyperuniformity in urban systems

Quantifying the spatial pattern of human settlements is crucial to understanding the complexity of urban systems. By analyzing the spatial distributions of settlements in diverse regions, we find that urban systems encode a hyperuniform order (exhibiting small density fluctuations), an intriguing pattern had been identified in physical and biological systems, but had rarely evidenced in socio-economic systems. We develop a simple model that shows how urban systems evolve into a hyperuniformity through matching growth and competition mechanisms. These results empirically and theoretically provide insights into the self-organization of cities, and reveal the hidden universality shared among social, physical, and biological systems.
