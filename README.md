# Hyperuniform organization in human settlements

Quantifying the spatial organization of human settlements is fundamental to understanding the complexity of urban systems. However, the quantitative patterns of the distribution of villages, towns, and cities that lie between random and regular, are still largely unknown. Here, by analyzing the geographic location of settlements in diverse regions, we show that the apparently complex urban systems can be characterized by disordered hyperuniformity (with small density fluctuations), an intriguing pattern that has been identified in many physical and biological systems, but has rarely been documented in socio-economic systems. By introducing the mechanisms of spatial matching and competition, we develop a growth model that shows how settlements evolve towards hyperuniformity. Our model also predicts the heavy-tail population distribution across settlements, in agreement with empirical observations. These results provide insights into the self-organization of cities, and reveal the universality of spatial organization shared by social, physical, and biological systems.
